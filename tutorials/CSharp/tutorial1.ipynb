That's the .NET bindings to libtorch, and it contains the .NET API. However, you also need one of several packages containing distributions of libtorch itself, the highly capable native-code engine behind PyTorch.\n",

    "Starting with version 0.93.4, there are bundled versions of these packages, which is what these tutorials rely on.\n",
